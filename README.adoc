== Proxy

Proxy acts as a fake notification provider (APNS / GCM). From consumer point of view, the 
notifications which the consumer sends to networks hit this proxy and proxy answers the consumer 
back as if the response came from the real providers.

This project is used for testing purposes.

Installation is done by `mvn clean install`. Resulting binary is in `impl/target/proxy`.

Proxy binary offers two commands. Every command covers the proxy for one notification platform.
There are two platfroms implemented - APNS and GCM

NOTE: If you want to start proxy for both networks, you have to have two running binaries of `proxy`.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./proxy help
usage: proxy <command> [<args>]

The most commonly used proxy commands are:
    apnsProxy   starts APNS proxy
    gcmProxy    starts GCM proxy
    help        Display help information

----

=== APNS proxy

APNS proxy is started by `apnsProxy` command.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./proxy help apnsProxy
NAME
        proxy apnsProxy - starts APNS proxy

SYNOPSIS
        proxy apnsProxy [--apnsKeystore <apnsKeystore>]
                [--apnsKeystoreAlgorithm <apnsKeystoreAlgorithm>]
                [--apnsKeystorePassword <apnsKeystorePassword>]
                [--apnsKeystoreType <apnsKeystoreType>]
                [--apnsMockFeedbackHost <apnsMockFeedbackHost>]
                [--apnsMockFeedbackPort <apnsMockFeedbackPort>]
                [--apnsMockGatewayHost <apnsMockGatewayHost>]
                [--apnsMockGatewayPort <apnsMockGatewayPort>]
                [--notificationEndpointHost <notificationEndpointHost>]
                [--notificationEndpointPort <notificationEndpointPort>]

OPTIONS
        --apnsKeystore <apnsKeystore>
            defaults to serverStore.p12 loaded from the jar

        --apnsKeystoreAlgorithm <apnsKeystoreAlgorithm>
            defaults to sunx509

        --apnsKeystorePassword <apnsKeystorePassword>
            defaults to 123456

        --apnsKeystoreType <apnsKeystoreType>
            defaults to PKCS12

        --apnsMockFeedbackHost <apnsMockFeedbackHost>
            defaults to 127.0.0.1

        --apnsMockFeedbackPort <apnsMockFeedbackPort>
            defaults to 16003

        --apnsMockGatewayHost <apnsMockGatewayHost>
            defaults to 127.0.0.1

        --apnsMockGatewayPort <apnsMockGatewayPort>
            defaults to 16002

        --notificationEndpointHost <notificationEndpointHost>
            defaults to 127.0.0.1

        --notificationEndpointPort <notificationEndpointPort>
            defaults to 17000
----

=== GCM proxy

GCM proxy is started by `gcmProxy` command.

GCM proxy is quite complex to implement due to impossibility of the GCM client library 
to say where you wish to route the notifications to be sent. You can not set 
another addresses of GCM notification servers as you can do with APNS client library 
hence some kind of MITM attack on the certificate level is needed.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./proxy help gcmProxy
NAME
        proxy gcmProxy - starts GCM proxy

SYNOPSIS
        proxy gcmProxy --gcmCertificate <gcmCertificate>
                --gcmCertificateKey <gcmCertificateKey>
                [--gcmMockServerHost <gcmMockServerHost>]
                [--gcmMockServerPort <gcmMockServerPort>]
                [--httpProxyHost <httpProxyHost>] [--httpProxyPort <httpProxyPort>]
                [--notificationEndpointHost <notificationEndpointHost>]
                [--notificationEndpointPort <notificationEndpointPort>]

OPTIONS
        --gcmCertificate <gcmCertificate>


        --gcmCertificateKey <gcmCertificateKey>


        --gcmMockServerHost <gcmMockServerHost>
            defaults to 127.0.0.1

        --gcmMockServerPort <gcmMockServerPort>
            defaults to 16001

        --httpProxyHost <httpProxyHost>
            defaults to 127.0.0.1

        --httpProxyPort <httpProxyPort>
            defaults to 16000

        --notificationEndpointHost <notificationEndpointHost>
            defaults to 127.0.0.1

        --notificationEndpointPort <notificationEndpointPort>
            defaults to 17000

=== Notification register endpoint

After you send some notifications to this proxy, they are internally cached so 
you can query the proxy instance what notifications it received so far.

You get these notifications by performing `GET` on address `notificationEndpointHost:notificationEndpointPort`.

The received JSON is just serialized model class you find in `model` artifact.

You can of course unmarshall the JSON at client side into model classes and work with them further as you wish.

You can clear all gathered notifications by calling `notificationEndpointHost:notificationEndpointPort/clear`.
